POEMS AND FRAGMENTS WRITTEN ABOUT I 7 9 3 (Page 115 reversed) FLOWER was offer’d to me 1\. Such a flower as may never bore; But I said, “ I’ve a pretty rose tree,” And I passed the sweet flower o’er.

Then I went to my pretty rose tree [In the silent of the night del.] To tend it by day & by night But my rose [was turned from me del.] [was fill’d del.] turn’d away with Jealousy And her thorns were my only delight.

Soon as she was gone from me A traveller came by; Silently, invisibly [He took her with a sigh del.] O, was no deny.

So sung a little clod of clay, Trodden with the cattle’s feet.

But a pebble of the brook Warbled out these metres meet: “ Love seeketh only self to please “To bind another to its delight, “ Joys in another’s loss of ease “ And builds a hell in heaven’s despite.

(Page 115 reversed) I LAID me down upon a bank Where love lay sleeping.

I heard among the rushes dank Weeping, Weeping.

Then I went to the heath & the wild To the thistles & thorns of the waste And they told me how they were beguil’d.

Driven out, & compel’d to be chaste.

(Page 115 reversed) I WENT to the garden of love, And I saw what I never had seen: ^ A chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green.

And the gates of the chapel were shut, And “ thou shalt not ” writ over the door, And I turn’d to the garden of love That so many sweet flowers bore; And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be.

And priests in black gounds were walking their rounds And binding with briars my joys & desires.

(Page 115 reversed) I SAW a chapel all of gold That none did dare to enter in.

And many weeping stood without, Weeping, mourning, worshipping.

I saw a serpent rise between The white pillars of the door, And he forc’d & forc’d & forc’d, [Till he broke the pearly door del.] Down the golden hinges tore.

And along the pavement sweet, Set with pearls & rubies bright.

All his slimy length he drew.

So I turn’d into a sty And laid me down among the swine.

(Page 114 reversed) I HEARD an Angel singing When the day was springing, “ Mercy, Pity, [& del.] Peace “ Is the world’s release.” Thus he sung all day Over the new mown hay, Till the sun went down And haycocks looked brown.

I heard a Devil curse Over the heath & the furze, “ Mercy could be no more, “ If there was nobody poor, “ And pity no more could be, “ If all were as happy as we.” [Thus he sang & del.] At his curse the sun went down.

And the heavens gave a frown.

I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I water’d it in fears Night & morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew by day & night Till it bore an apple bright; [And I gave it to my foe del.] And my foe beheld it shine.

And he knew that it was mine, And into my garden stole, When the night had veil’d the pole.

Then again old Nobodaddy swore He ne’er had seen such a thing before, Since Noah was shut in the ark, Since Eve first chose her hellfire spark, Since ’twas the fashion to go naked, Since the old anything was created, And so feeling, he beg’d me to turn again And ease poor Klopstock’s ninefold pain.

June 1793 POEMS AND FRAGMENTS WRITTEN ABOUT 180O-1803 (Pages 2 to 2) MY Spectre around me night & day Like a Wild beast guards my way.

My Emanation far within Weeps incessantly for my Sin.

[6 del] 3 He scents thy footsteps in the snow, Wheresoever thou dost go Thro’ the wintry hail & rain.

When wilt thou return again?

[6 del] 4 [Didst del.] Dost thou not in Pride & scorn Fill with tempests all my morn.

And with jealousies & fears Fill my pleasant nights with tears?

[7 del\ [4 del.] 5 Seven of my sweet loves thy knife Has bereaved of their life.

Their marble tombs I built with tears And with cold & shuddering fears.

[8 del.'] [5 del.] 6 Seven more loves weep night & day Round the tombs where my loves lay.

And seven more loves attend each night Around my couch with torches bright.

[6 del.] 7 And seven more Loves in my bed Crown with wine my mournful head.

[ 1 o del.] [7 del.] 8 When wilt thou return & view My loves, & them to life renew?

When wilt thou return & live?

When wilt thou pity [& del.] as I forgive?

“ Never, Never I return: “ Still for Victory I burn.

“ Living, thee alone I’ll have “ And when dead I’ll be thy Grave.

“ Thro’ the Heaven & Earth & Hell “ Thou shalt never never quell: “ I will fly & thou pursue, “ Night & Morn the flight renew.” Till [thou del.] I turn from Female Love, And [dig del.] root up the Infernal Grove, [Thou del.] I shall never worthy be To Step into Eternity.

And, to end they cruel mocks, Annihilate thee on the rocks, And another form create To be subservient to my Fate.

*3 Let us agree to give up Love, And root up the infernal grove; Then shall we return & see The worlds of happy Eternity.

& Throughout all Eternity I forgive you, you forgive me.

As our dear Redeemer said: “ This the Wine & this the Bread.” O’er [thy del.] my Sins thou sit & moan: Hast thou no sins of thy own?

O’er [thy del.] my Sins thou sit & weep.

And lull [my del.] thy own Sins fast asleep.

What Transgressions I commit Are for they Transgressions fit.

They thy Harlots, thou their slave.

And my Bed becomes their Grave.

And let us go to the [word illegible] [Line illegible] Woman that does not love your wiles Shall never [words illegible] your smiles.

You throw the sand against the wind, And the wind blows it back again.

(Page 12) 1 T SAW a Monk of [Constantine e/e/.] Charlemaine X Arise before my sight: I talk’d to the Grey Monk where he stood In beams of infernal light.

2 Gibbon arose with a lash of steel, And Voltaire with a wracking wheel.

[Charlemaine & his barons bold del.] The Schools in Clouds of Learning roll’d Arose with War in iron & gold.

3 “ [Seditious del.] Thou Lazy Monk,” [said Charlemaine del.] they said afar, [“ The Glory of War thou condemn’st in vain del.] “ In vain condemning Glorious War, “ And in thy Cell thou shall ever dwell.

“ Rise, War, & bind him in his Cell! ” 4 The blood red ran from the Grey monk’s side.

His hands & feet were wounded wide, His body bent, his arms & knees Like to the roots of ancient trees.

“ I see, I see,” the Mother said, “ My Children will die for lack of bread.

“ What more has the merciless tyrant said ? ” The Monk sat down on her stony bed.

His Eye was dry, no tear could flow, A hollow groan first spoke his woe.

[A line del.] He trembl’d & shudder’d upon the bed: At lenght with a feeble cry he said: “ When God commanded this hand to write “ In the studious hours of deep midnight, “ He told me that All I wrote should prove “ The bane of all that on Earth I love.

“ My brother starv’d between two walls; “ They children’s cry my soul appalls.

“ [But del.] I mock’d at the wrack & griding chain: “ My bent body mocks at their torturing pain.

“ Thy father drew his sword in the north; “ With his thousands strong he is marched forth; “ Thy brother has armed himself in steel “To revenge the wrongs thy Children feel.

“ But vain the sword & vain the bow, “ They never can work war’s overthrow.

“ The Hermit’s prayer & the widow’s tear “ Alone can free the world from fear.

“ The hand of vengeance sought the bed “ To which the purple tyrant fled.

“ The iron hand crush’d the tyrant’s head “ [And usurp’d the tyrant’s throne & bed del.\ “ And became a tyrant in his stead.

“ Untill the Tyrant himself relent, “ The Tyrant who first the black bow bent, “ Slaughter shall heap the bloody plain; “ Resistance & war is the Tyrant’s gain.

“ But The Tear of Love & forgiveness sweet “ And submission to death beneath his feet— “ The tear shall melt the sword of steel, “ And every wound it has made shall heal.

“ For the tear is an intellectual thing, “ And a sigh is the Sword of an Angel King, “ And the bitter groan [for another’s del.] of the Marty woe “ Is an arrow from the Almightie’s bow.” [additional stanzas] 5 When Satan first the black bow bent And the Moral Law from the Gospel rent, He forg’d the Law into a Sword And spill’d the blood of Mercy’s Lord.

6 [O, Charlemaine ! O, Charlemaine ! del.] Titus! Constantine ! Charlemaine !

O Voltaire ! Rousseau ! Gibbon ! vain Your [mocks & scorn del.] Grecian mocks & Roman sword Against this image of his Lord.

A tear is an &c.

Gibbon plied his lash of steel : Voltaire turn’d his wracking wheel : Charlemaine & his barons bold Stood by & mocked in iron & gold.

The Wheel of Voltaire whirl’d on high, Gibbon aloud his lash does ply, Charlemaine & his clouds of War Muster around the Polar Star.

A Grecian Scoff is a wracking wheel.

The Roman pride is a sword of steel.

MY Wife was told by a Spirit to look for her fortune by opening by chance a book which she had in her hand ; it was Bysshe’s Art of Poetry. She open’d the following: I saw ’em kindle with desire While with soft sighs they blew the fire.

Saw the approaches of their joy.

He growing more fierce & she less coy.

Saw how they mingled melting rays Exchanging Love a thousand ways.

Kind was the force on every side, \ Her new desire she could not hide, > Nor would the shepherd be denied.) The blessed minute he pursu’d Till she transported in his arms Yields to the Conqueror all her charms.

His panting breast to hers now join’d They feast on raptures unconfin’d, Vast & luxuriant, such as prove The immortality of Love.

For who but a Divinity Could mingle souls to that degree And melt them into extasy?

Now like the Phoenix both expire While from the ashes of their fire Spring up a new & soft desire.

Like charmers thrice they did invoke The God & thrice new Vigor took.

Behn.

I WAS so well pleased with her Luck that I thought I would try my Own & open’d the following: As when the winds their airy quarrel try, Justling from every quarter of the sky, This way & that the Mountain oak they bear, His boughs they shelter & his branches tear, With leaves & falling mast they spread the Ground.

The hollow valleys Eccho to the sound.

Unmov’d the royal plant their fury mocks, Or shaken clings more closely to the rocks.

For as he shoots his lowring head on high So deep in earth his fix’d foundations lie.

(Page l) IF Men of weak capacities [in Art del.] have alone the Power of Execution in Art, Mr. B. has now put to the test. If to Invent & to draw well hinders the Executive Power in Art, & his strokes are still to be Condemn’d because they are unlike those of Artists who are Unacquainted with Drawing [& the accompanying del.], is now to be Decided by The Public.

Mr. B.’s Inventive Powers & his Scientific Knowledge of Drawing is on all hands acknowledg’d; it only remains to be Certified whether [The Fool’s hand or the del.] Physiognomic Strength & Power is to give Place to Imbecillity, [and whether (several words illegible') an unabated study & practise of forty Years (for I devoted myself to engraving in my Earliest Youth) are sufficient to elevate me above the Mediocrity to which I have hitherto been the victim, del.] In a work of Art it is not Fine Tints that are required, but Fine Forms; fine Tints with- out, are nothing. Fine Tints without Fine Forms are always the Subterfuge of the Blockhead.

I account it a Public Duty respectfully to address myself to The Chalcographic Society & to Express to them my opinion (the result of the constant Practice & Experience of Many Years) That Engraving as an art is Lost in England owing to an artfully propagated [in a most wretched state of injury from an del.] opinion that Drawing spoils an Engraver [which opin¬ ion has been held out to me by such men as Flaxman, Romney, Stothard del.]. I request the Society to inspect my Print, of which drawing is the Foundation & indeed the Superstructure: it is drawing on copper, as Painting ought to be drawing on canvas or any other [table del.] surface, & nothing Else. I request likewise that the Society will compare the Prints of Bartolozzi, Woolett, Strange &c. with the old English Por¬ traits, that is, compare the Modern Art with the Art as it existed Previous to the Enterance of Vandyke and Rubens into this Country, since which English Engraving is Lost, & I am sure [of del.] the Result of the comparison will be that the Society must be of my Opinion that engraving, by Losing drawing, has Lost all the character & all Expression, without which The Art is Lost.

(Pages 51 to 57; In this Plate Mr. B. has resumed the style with which he set out in life, of which Heath & Stothard were the awkward im¬ itators at that time; it is the style of Alb. Durer’s Histories & the old Engravers, which cannot be imitated by any one who does not understand drawing, & which, according to Heath & Stothard, Flaxman, & even Romney, spoils an Engraver; for Each of these Men have repeatedly asserted this Absurdity to me in Condemnation of my Work & approbation of Heath’s lame imitation, Stothard being such a fool as to suppose that his blundering blurs can be made out & delineated by any Engraver who knows how to cut dots & lozenges equally well with those little prints which I engraved after him five & twenty years ago & by which he got his reputation as a draughtsman.

The manner in which my Character has been blasted these forty years, both as an artist & a Man, may be seen particularly in a Sunday Paper cal’d the Examiner, Publish’d in Beaufort Buildings (We all know that Editors of Newspapers trouble their heads very little about art & science, & that they are always paid for what they put in upon these ungracious Sub¬ jects), & the manner in which I have routed out the nest of villains will be seen in a Poem concerning my Three years’ Herculean Labours at Felpham, which I will soon Publish.

Secret Calumny & open Professions of Friendship are common enough all the world over, but have never been so good an occasion of Poetic Imagery. When a Base Man means to be your Enemy he always begins with being your Friend. Flax- man cannot deny that one of the very first Monuments he did, I gratuitously design’d for him; at the same time he was blast¬ ing my character as an Artist to Macklin, my Employer, as Macklin told me at the time; how much of his Homer & Dante he will allow to be mine I do not know, as he went far enough off to Publish them, even to Italy, but the Public will know & Posterity will know.

Many People are so foolish [as] to think that they can wound Mr. Fuseli over my Shoulder; they will find themselves mis¬ taken ; they could not wound even Mr. Barry so.

A certain Portrait Painter said To me in a boasting way, “ Since I have Practised Painting I have lost all idea of “ drawing.” Such a Man must know that I look’d upon him with contempt; he did not care for this any more than West did, who hesitated & equivocated with me upon the same subject, at which time he asserted that Woolett’s Prints were superior to Basire’s because they had more Labour & Care; now this is contrary to the truth. Woolett did not know how to put so much labour into a head or a foot as Basire did; he did not know how to draw the Leaf of a tree; all his study was clean strokes & mossy tints—how then should he be able to make use of either Labour or Care, unless the Labour & Care of Imbe- cillity ? The Life’s Labour of Mental Weakness scarcely Equals one Hour of the Labour of Ordinary Capacity, like the full Gallop of the Gouty Man to the ordinary walk of youth & health. I allow that there is such a thing as high finish’d Ignorance, as there may be a fool or a knave in an Embroider’d Coat; but I say that the Embroidery of the Ignorant finisher is not like a Coat made by another, but is an Emanation from Ignorance itself, & its finishing is like its master—The Life’s Labour of Five Hundred Idiots, for he never does the Work Himself.

What is Call’d the English Style of Engraving, such as pro¬ ceeded from the Toilettes of Woolett & Strange (for theirs were Fribble’s Toilettes) can never produce Character & Expression.

I knew the Men intimately, from their Intimacy with Basire, my Master, & knew them both to be heavy lumps of Cunning & Ignorance, as their works shew to all the Continent, who Laugh at the Contemptible Pretences of Englishmen to Im¬ prove Art before they even know the first [lines del.\ Begin¬ nings of Art. I hope this Print will redeem my Country from this Coxcomb situation & shew that it is only some Englishmen, and not All, who are thus ridiculous in their Pretences. Adver¬ tisements in Newspapers are no proof of Popular approbation, but often the Contrary. A Man who Pretends to Improve Fine Art does not know what Fine Art is. Ye English Engravers must come down from your high flights; ye must condescend to study Marc Antonio & Albert Durer. Ye must begin before you attempt to finish or improve, & when you have begun you will know better than to think of improving what cannot be improv’d. It is very true, what you have said for these thirty two Years. I am Mad or Else you are so; both of us cannot be in our right senses. Posterity will judge by our Works.

Woolett’s & Strange’s works are like those of Titian & Correggio: the Life’s Labour of Ignorant Journeymen, Suited to the Purposes of Commerce no doubt, for Commerce Cannot endure Individual Merit; its insatiable Maw must be fed by What all can do Equally well; at least it is so in England, as I have found to my Cost these Forty Years.

Commerce is so far from being beneficial to Arts, or to Empires, that it is destructive of both, as all their History shews, for the above Reason of Individual Merit being its Great hatred. Empires flourish till they become Commercial, & then they are scatter’d abroad to the four winds.

Wooletts best works were Etch’d by Jack Brown. Woolett Etch’d very bad himself. Strange’s Prints were, when I knew him, all done by Aliamet & his french journeymen whose names I forget.

“ The Cottagers,” & “ Jocund Peasants,” the “ Views in Kew Gardens,” “ Foots Cray,” & “ Diana,” & “ Acteon,” & in short all that are Call’d Woolett’s were Etch’d by Jack Browne, & in Woolett’s works the Etching is All, tho’ even in these, a single leaf of a tree is never correct.

Such Prints as Woolett & Strange produc’d will do for those who choose to purchase the Life’s labour of Ignorance & Imbe- cillity, in Preference to the Inspired Moments of Genius & Animation.

(Page 60) I also knew something of Tom Cooke who Engraved after Hogarth. Cooke wished to Give to Hogarth what he could take from Rafael, that is Outline & Mass & Colour, but he could not [& Hogarth with all his Merit. . . del.].

(Page Sy) I do not pretend to Paint better than Rafael or Mich. Angelo or Julio Romano or Alb. Durer, but I do Pretend to Paint finer than Rubens or Remb1. or Correggio or Titian. I do not Pre¬ tend to Engrave finer than Alb. Durer, Goltzius, Sadeler or Edelinck, but I do pretend to Engrave finer than Strange, Woolett, Hall or Bartolozzi, & all because I understand draw¬ ing which They understood not.

(Page 58J In this manner the English Public have been imposed upon for many Years under the impression that Engraving & Paint¬ ing are somewhat Else besides drawing. Painting is drawing on Canvas, & Engraving is drawing on Copper, & Nothing Else; & he who pretends to be either Painter or Engraver without being a Master of drawing is an Imposter. We may be Clever as Pugilists, but as Artists we are & have long been the Con¬ tempt of the Continent, [word del.] Gravelot once said to My Master, Basire, “ [you del.] de “ English may be very clever in [your del.] deir own opinions, but “ [you del.] dey do not draw de [the written over] draw.” Resentment for Personal Injuries has had some share in this Public Address, But Love to My Art & Zeal for my Country a much Greater.

(Page S9) Men think they can Copy Nature as Correctly as I copy Imagination; this they will find Impossible, & all the Copies or Pretended Copiers of Nature, from Rembrandt to Reynolds, Prove that Nature becomes [word del.] to its Victim nothing but Blots & Blurs. Why are Copiers of Nature Incorrect, while Copiers of Imagination are Correct? this is manifest to all.

(Pages 60 to 62) The Originality of this Production makes it necessary to say a few words.

While the Works [of Imitators del.] of Pope & Dryden are look’d upon as [in the same class of del.] the same Art with those of Milton & Shakespeare, while the works of Strange & Woollett are look’d upon as the same Art with those of Rafael & Albert Durer, there can be no Art in a Nation but such as is Subservient to the interest of the Monopolizing Trader [words del.] [who Manufactures Art by the Hands of Ignorant Jour¬ neymen till at length Christian Charity is held out as a Motive to encourage a Blockhead, & he is Counted the Greatest Genius who can sell a Good-for-Nothing Commodity for a Great Price. Obedience to the Will of the Monopolist is call’d Virtue, and the really Industrious, Virtuous & Independent Barry is driven out to make room for a pack of Idle Sycophants with whitlows on their fingers, mostly del.]. Englishmen, rouze yourselves from the fatal Slumber into which Booksellers & Trading Dealers have thrown you, Under the artfully propa¬ gated pretence that a Translation or a Copy of any kind can be as honourable to a Nation as An Original, [Belying del.] Belying the English Character in that well known Saying, "Englishmen Improve what others Invent.’ This Even Hogarth’s Works Prove a detestable Falshood. No Man Can Improve An Original Invention. [Since Hogarth’s time we have had very few Efforts of Originality del.] Nor can an Original Invention Exist without Execution, Organized 6c minutely delineated 6c Articulated, Either by God or Man. I do not mean smooth’d up 6c Niggled 6c Poco-Pen’d, and all the beauties pick’d out [word dell] 6c blurr’d 6c blotted, but Drawn with a firm 6c decided hand at once [with all its Spots 6c Blemishes which are beauties 6c not faults del.], like Fuseli 6c Michael Angelo, Shakespeare 6c Milton.

I have heard many People say, "Give me the Ideas. It is no 'matter what Words you put them into,’ 6c others say, ' Give 'me the Design, it is no matter for the Execution.’ These People know Enough of Artifice, but Nothing Of Art. Ideas cannot be Given but in their minutely Appropriate Words, nor Can a Design be made without its minutely Appropriate Ex¬ ecution. The unorganized Blots 6c Blurs of Rubens 6c Titian are not Art, nor can their Method ever express Ideas or Imagina¬ tions any more than Pope’s Metaphysical Jargon of Rhym¬ ing. Unappropriate Execution is the Most nauseous of all affectation 6c foppery. He who copies does not Execute; he only Imitates what is already Executed. Execution is only the result of Invention.

(Page 63) Whoever looks at any of the Great 6c Expensive Works of Engraving that have been Publish’d by English Traders must feel a Loathing 6c disgust, 6c accordingly most Englishmen have a Contempt for Art, [which will del.] which is the Greatest Curse that can fall upon a Nation.

He who could represent Christ uniformly like a Drayman must have Queer Conceptions; consequently his Execution must have been as Queer, & those must be Queer fellows who give great sums for such nonsense & think it fine Art.

The Modern Chalcographic Connoisseurs & Amateurs admire only the work of the journeyman, Picking out of whites & blacks in what is call’d Tints; they despise drawing, which despises them in return. They see only whether every thing is toned down but one spot of light.

Mr. B. submits to a more severe tribunal; he invites the ad¬ mirers of old English Portraits to look at his Print.

(Page 64; I do not know whether Homer is a Liar & that there is no such thing as Generous Contention: I know that all those with whom I have Contended in Art have strove not to Excell, but to Starve me out by Calumny & the Arts of Trading Combina¬ tion.

(Page 66) It is Nonsense for Noblemen & Gentlemen to offer Pre¬ miums for the Encouragement of Art when such Pictures as these can be done without Premiums; let them Encourage what Exists Already, & not endeavour to counteract by tricks; let it no more be said that Empires Encourage Arts, for it is Arts that Encourage Empires. Arts & Artists are Spiritual & laugh at Mortal Contingencies. It is in their Power to hinder Instruction but not to Instruct, just as it is in their Power to Murder a Man but not to make a Man.

Let us teach Buonaparte, & whomsoever else it may concern, That it is not Arts that follow & attend upon Empire, but Empire that attends upon & follows [where Art leads del.] The Arts.

(Page 67J No Man of Sense can think that an Imitation of the Objects of Nature is The Art of Painting, or that such Imitation, which any one may easily perform, is worthy of Notice, much less that such an Art should be the Glory & Pride of a Nation [& that the man who does this is del.]. The Italians laugh at English Connoisseurs, who are [All del.] most of them such silly Fellows as to believe this.

A Man sets himself down with Colours & with all the Articles of Painting; he puts a Model before him & he copies that so neat as to make it a deception: now let any Man of Sense ask himself one Question: Is this Art? can it be worthy of admira¬ tion to any body of Understanding? Who could not do this?

what man who has eyes and an ordinary share of patience can¬ not do this neatly? Is this Art? Or is it glorious to a Nation to produce such contemptible Copies? Countrymen, Country¬ men, do not suffer yourselves to be disgraced !

(Page 66) The English Artist may be assured that he is doing an injury & injustice to his Country while he studies & imitates the Effects of Nature. England will never rival Italy while we servilely copy what the Wise Italians, Rafael & Michael Angelo, scorned, nay abhorred, as Vasari tells us.

Call that the Public Voice which is their Error, Like [to del.] as a Monkey peeping in a Mirror Admires all his colours brown & warm And never once percieves his ugly form.

What kind of Intellects must he have who sees only the Colours of things & not the Forms of Things.

(Page 71) A Jockey that is anything of a Jockey will never buy a Horse by the Colour, & a Man who has got any brains will never buy a Picture by the Colour.

When I tell any Truth it is not for the sake of Convincing those who do not know it, but for the sake of Understanding those who do (Pages 18-19^ What Man of Sense will lay out his Money upon the Life’s Labours of Imbecility & Imbecility’s Journeymen, or think to Educate a Fool how to build a Universe with Farthing Balls?

The Contemptible Idiots who have been call’d Great Men of late Years ought to rouze the Public Indignation of Men of Sense in all Professions.

There is not, because there cannot be, any difference of Effect in the Pictures of Rubens & Rembrandt: when you have seen one of their Pictures you have seen all. It is not so with Rafael, Julio Roman[o], Alb. d[urer], Mich. Ang. Every Pic¬ ture of theirs has a different & appropriate Effect.

Yet I do not shrink from the comparison, in Either Relief or Strength of Colour, with either Rembrandt or Rubens; on the contrary I court the Comparison & fear not the Result, but not in a dark corner. Their Effects are in Every Picture the same.

Mine are in every Picture different.

I hope my Countrymen will Excuse me if I tell them a Wholesome truth. Most Englishmen, when they look at a Picture, immediately set about searching for Points of Light & clap the Picture into a dark corner. This, when done by [this in del.] Grand Works, is like looking for Epigrams in Homer.

A point of light is a Witticism; many are destructive of all Art. One is an Epigram only & no Grand Work can have them.

Rafael, Mich. Angelo, & Jul. Rom. are accounted ignorant of that Epigrammatic Wit in Art because they avoid it as a destructive Machine, as it is.

That Vulgar Epigram in Art, Rembrandt’s “ Hundred Guelders,” has entirely put an End to all Genuine & Appro¬ priate Effect; all, both Morning & Night, is now a dark cavern.

It is the Fashion; they Produce Dryness [?] & Monotony.

When you view a Collection of Pictures painted since Venetian Art was the Fashion, or Go into a Modern Exhibition, with a very few Exceptions, Every Picture has the same Effect, a Piece of Machinery of Points of Light to be put into a dark hole.

Mr. B. repeats that there is not one Character or Expression in this Print which could be Produced with the Execution of Titian, Rubens, Coreggio, Rembrandt, or any of that Class.

Character & Expression can only be Expressed by those who Feel Them. Even Hogarth’s Execution cannot be Copied or Improved. Gentlemen of Fortune who give Great Prices for Pictures should consider the following. Rubens’s Luxembourg Gallery is Confessed on all hands [because it bears the evidence at first view del.] to be the work of a Blockhead: it bears this Evidence in its face. How can its Execution be any other than the Work of a Blockhead? Bloated [Creatures & del.] Gods, Mercury, Juno, Venus, & the rattle traps of Mythology & the lumber of an [old del.] awkward French Palace are thrown together around Clumsy & Ricketty Princes & Princesses higgledy piggledy. On the Contrary, Julio Romfano’s] Palace of T at Mantua, is allow’d on all hands to be the Product of a Man of the Most Profound sense & Genius, & yet his Execu¬ tion is pronounc’d by English Connoisseurs & Reynolds, their doll, to be unfit for the Study of the Painter. Can I speak with too great Contempt of such Contemptible fellows? If all the io5 Princes in Europe, like Louis XIV & Charles the first, were to Patronize such Blockheads, I, William Blake, a Mental Prince, should decollate & Hang their Souls as Guilty of Mental High Treason.

Who that has Eyes cannot see that Rubens & Corregio must have been very weak & Vulgar fellows? & we are [we del.] to imitate their Execution. This is [as if del.] like what Sr Francis Bacon [should downright assert del.] says, that a healthy Child should be taught & compell’d to walk like a Cripple, while the Cripple must be taught to walk like healthy people. O rare wisdom!

I am really sorry to see my Countrymen trouble themselves about Politics. If Men were Wise, the Most arbitrary Princes could not hurt them. If they are not wise, the Freest Govern¬ ment is compell’d to be a Tyranny. Princes appear to me to be Fools. Houses of Commons & Houses of Lords appear to me to be fools; they seem to me to be something Else besides Human Life.

(Pages 20-21) The wretched State of the Arts in this Country & in Europe, originating in the wretched State of Political Science, which is the Science of Sciences, Demands a firm & determinate conduct on the part of Artists to Resist the Contemptible Counter Arts [set on foot del.] Establish’d by such contemptible Politicians as Louis XIV & [but del.] originally set on foot by Venetian Pic¬ ture traders, Music traders, & Rhime traders, to the destruc¬ tion of all true art as it is this Day. To recover Art has been the business of my life to the Florentine Original & if possible to go beyond that Original; this I thought the only pursuit worthy of [an Englishman del.] a Man. To Imitate I abhor.

I obstinately adhere to the true Style of Art such as Michael Angelo, Rafael, Jul. Rom., Alb. Durer, left it [the Art of Invention, not of Imitation. Imagination is My World; this world of Dross in beneath my Notice & beneath the Notice of the Public, del.] I demand therefore of the Amateurs of art the Encouragement which is my due; if they continue to refuse, theirs is the loss, not mine, & theirs is the Contempt of Poster¬ ity. I have Enough in the Approbation of fellow labourers; this is my glory & exceeding great reward. I go on & nothing can hinder my course: and in Melodious accent I Will sit me down & Cry I, I.

(Page 20 sideways) An Example of these Contrary Arts is given us in the Charac¬ ters of Milton & Dryden as they are written in a Poem signed with the name of Nat Lee, which perhaps he never wrote & perhaps he wrote in a paroxysm of insanity, In which it is said that Milton’s Poem is a rough Unfinish’d Piece & Dryden has finish’d it. Now let Dryden’s Fall & Milton’s Paradise be read, & I will assert that every Body of Understanding [will del.] must cry out Shame on such Niggling & Poco-Pen as Dryden has degraded Milton with. But at the same time I will allow that Stupidity will Prefer Dryden, because it is in Rhyme [but for no other cause del.] & Monotonous Sing Song, Sing Song from beginning to end. Such are Bartolozzi, Woolett & Strange.

(Page 23; [Four lines del.] The Painters of England are unemploy’d in Public Works, while the Sculptors have continual & super¬ abundant employment. Our Churches & Abbeys are treasures of [words del.] their producing for ages back, While Painting is excluded. Painting, the Principal Art, has no place [in our del.] among our almost only public works. [While del.] Yet it is more adapted to solemn ornament than [word del.] Marble can be, as it is capable of being Placed on any heighth & indeed would make a Noble finish Placed above the Great Public Monuments in Westminster, St. Pauls & other Cathedrals. To the Society for Encouragement of Arts I address myself with [duty & del.] Respectful duty, requesting their Consideration of my Plan as a Great Public [word del.] means of advancing Fine Art in Protestant Communities. Monuments to the dead.

Painted by Historical & Poetical Artists, like Barry & Morti¬ mer (I forbear to name living Artists tho’ equally worthy), I say, Monuments so Painted must make England What Italy is, an Envied Storehouse of Intellectual Riches.

(Pages 24-25; It has been said of late years The English Public have no Taste for Painting. This is a Falsehood. The English are as Good Judges of Painting as of Poetry, & they prove it in their Contempt for Great Collections of all the Rubbish of the Con¬ tinent brought here by Ignorant Picture dealers. An English¬ man may well say, ' I am no Judge of Painting,’ when he is shewn these Smears & Dawbs at an immense price & told that such is the Art of Painting. I say the English Public are true Encouragers of real Art, while they discourage and look with Contempt on False Art.

In a Commercial Nation Impostors are abroad in all Profes¬ sions ; these are the greatest Enemies of Genius [Mr. B. thinks it his duty to Caution the Public against a Certain Impostor who del.] In [our Art del.] the Art of Painting these Impostors sedulously propagate an Opinion that Great Inventors Cannot Execute. This Opinion is as destructive of the true Artist as it is false by all Experience. Even Hogarth cannot be either Copied or Improved. Can Anglus never Discern Perfection but in the Journeyman’s Labour?

(Pages 24-25 sideways) I know my Execution is not like Any Body Else. I do not intend it should be so; none but Blockheads Copy one an¬ other. My Conception & Invention are on all hands allow’d to be Superior. My Execution will be found so too. To what is it that Gentleman of the first Rank both in Genius & Fortune have subscribed their Names? To My Inventions: the Execu¬ tive part they never disputed: the Lavish praise I have recieved from all Quarters for Invention & drawing has Generally been accompanied by this: “ he can concieve but he cannot “ Execute ”; this Absurd assertion has done me, & may still do me, the greatest mischief. I call for Public protection against these Villains. I am, like others. Just Equal in Invention & in Ex¬ ecution as my works shew. I, in my own defence, Challenge a Competition with the finest Engravings & defy the most critical judge to make the Comparison Honestly, asserting in my own Defence that This Print is the Finest that has been done or is likely to be done in England, where drawing, its foundation, is Condemn’d, and absurd Nonsense about dots & Lozenges & Clean Strokes made to occupy the attention to the Neglect of all real Art. I defy any Man to Cut Cleaner Strokes than I do, or rougher where I please, & assert that he who thinks he can Engrave, or Paint either, without being a Master of drawing, is a Fool. Painting is drawing on Canvas, & Engraving is drawing on Copper, & nothing Else. Drawing is Execution, & nothing Else, & he who draws best must be the best Artist; to this I subscribe my name as a Public Duty.

William Blake.

P. S.—I do not believe that this Absurd opinion ever was set on foot till in my Outset into life it was artfully publish’d, both in whispers & in print, by Certain persons whose robberies from me made it necessary to them that I should be [left del.] hid in a corner; it never was supposed that a Copy could be better than an original, or near so Good, till a few Years ago it became the interest of certain envious Knaves.

[PUBLIC ADDRESS] ADDITIONAL PASSAGES (Page 38; There is just the same Science in Lebrun or Rubens, or even Vanloo, that there is in Rafael or Mich. Angelo, but not the same Genius. Science is soon got; the other never can be acquired, but must be born.

(Page 39; I do not condemn Rubens, Rembrandt or Titian because they did not understand drawing, but because they did not Understand Colouring; how long shall I be forced to beat this into Men’s Ears? I do not condemn [Bartolozzi del.] Strange or Woolett because they did not understand drawing, but because they did not understand Graving. I do not condemn Pope or Dryden because they did not understand Imagination, but because they did not understand Verse. Their Colouring, Graving & Verse can never be applied to Art—that is not either Colouring, Graving or Verse which is Unappropriate to the Subject. He who makes a design must know the Effect & Colouring Proper to be put to that design & will never take that of Rubens, Rembrandt or Titian to [put del.] turn that which is Soul & Life into a Mill or Machine.

(Pages 46-47J They say there is no Strait Line in Nature; this Is a Lie, like all that they say. For there is Every Line in Nature. But I will tell them what is Not in Nature. An Even Tint is not in Nature; it produces Heaviness. Nature’s Shadows are Ever varying, & a Ruled Sky that is quite Even never can Produce a Natural Sky ; the same with every Object in a Picture, its Spots are its beauties. Now, Gentlemen Critics, how do you like this? You may rage, but what I say, I will prove by Such Prac¬ tise & have already done, so that you will rage to your own destruction. Woolett I knew very intimately by his intimacy with Basire, & I knew him to be one of the most ignorant fellows that I ever knew. A Machine is not a Man nor a Work of Art; it is destructive of Humanity & of Art; the word Machination [word del.]. Woolett I know did not know how to Grind his Graver. I know this; he has often proved his Ignorance before me at Basire’s by laughing at Basire’s knife tools & ridiculing the Forms of Basire’s other Gravers till Basire was quite dash’d & out of Conceit with what he himself knew, but his Impudence had a Contrary Effect on me.

Englishmen have been so used to Journeymen’s undecided bungling that they cannot bear the firmness of a Master’s Touch.

Every Line is the Line of Beauty ; it is only fumble & Bungle which cannot draw a Line; this only is Ugliness. That is not a Line which doubts & Hesitates in the Midst of its Course.

DRAFT FOR PROSPECTUS OF THE ENGRAVING OF CHAUCER’S CANTERBURY PILGRIMS.

WRITTEN 1809 (Page 117 to 119) BLAKE’S CHAUCER AN ORIGINAL ENGRAVING By WILLIAM BLAKE FROM HIS FRESCO PAINTING OF CHAUCER’S CANTERBURY PILGRIMS MR. B., having from early Youth cultivated the two Arts, Painting & Engraving, & during a Period of Forty Years never suspended his Labours on Copper for a single day, Submits with Confidence to Public Patronage & requests the attention of the Amateurs in a Large [Work del.] Stroke En¬ graving, 3 feet 1 inch long by one foot high, Containing Thirty original high finish’d whole Length Portraits on Horseback Of Chaucer’s Characters, where every Character & every Expres¬ sion, every Lineament of Head, Hand & Foot, every particular of dress or Costume, where every Horse is appropriate to his Rider & the Scene or Landscape with its Villages, Cottages, Churches, & the Inn in Southwark is minutely labour’d, not by the hands of Journeymen, but by the Original Artist him¬ self, even to the Stuffs & Embroidery of the Garments, the hair upon the Horses, the Leaves upon the Trees, & the Stones & Gravel upon the road; the Great Strength of Colouring & depth of work peculiar to Mr. B.’s Prints will be here found accompanied by a Procession not to be seen but in the work of an Original Artist.

SIR JEFFERY CHAUCER & THE NINE & TWENTY PILGRIMS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO CANTERBURY The time chosen is early morning before sun rise, when the jolly Company are just quitting the Tabarde Inn. The Knight & Squire with the Squire’s Yeoman lead the Procession: then the Youthful Abbess, her Nun & three Priests; her Grey¬ hounds attend her— “ Of small Hounds had she that she fed “ With roast flesh, milk & wastel bread.” Next follow the Friar & Monk; then the Tapiser, the Par¬ doner, the Sompnour & the Manciple. After these “ Our Host,” who occupies the Center of the cavalcade (the Fun after¬ wards exhibited on the road may be seen depicted in his jolly face) directs them to the Knight (whose solemn Gallantry no less fixes attention) as the person who will be likely to com- mense their Task of each telling a Tale in their order. After the Host follow the Shipman, the Haberdasher, the Dyer, the Frank¬ lin, the Physician, the Plowman, the Lawyer, the Poor Parson, the Merchant, the Wife of Bath, the Cook, the Oxford Scholar, Chaucer himself, & the Reeve comes as Chaucer has described: “ And ever he rode hinderest of the rout.” These last are issuing from the Gateway of the Inn, the Cook & Wife of Bath are both taking their morning’s draught of comfort. Spectators stand at the Gateway of the Inn & are composed of an old man, a woman & children.

ll3 The Landscape is an Eastward view of the Country from the Tabarde Inn in Southwark as it may be supposed to have appear’d in Chaucer’s time, interspersed with Cottages & Villages ; the first beams of the Sun are seen above the Horizon.

Some buildings & spires indicate the situation of the Great City. The Inn is a Gothic Building which Thynne in his Glossary says was the Lodging of the Abbot of Hyde by Winchester. On the Inn is inscribed its title, & a proper advantage is taken of this circumstance to describe the subject of the Picture; the Words written in Gothic Letters over the Gateway are as follow: “ The Tabarde Inne by Henry Bailly “ the Lodgyng House for Pilgrims who Journey to Saint Thomas’s “ Shrine at Canterbury.” The Characters of Chaucer’s Pilgrims are the Characters that compose all Ages & Nations; as one Age falls another rises, different to Mortal Sight, but to Immortals only the same; for we see the same Characters repeated again & again, in Animals, in Vegetables, in Minerals & in Men. Nothing new occurs in Identical Existence: Accident ever varies, Substance can never suffer change nor decay.

[A VISION OF THE LAST JUDGMENT] (Page 70) For the Year 1810 ADDITIONS TO BLAKE’S CATALOGUE OF PICTURES & e.

(Page JO) THE Last Judgment [will be] when all those are Cast away who trouble Religion with Questions concerning Good & Evil or Eating of the Tree of those Knowledges or Reason- ings which hinder the Vision of God, turning all into a Consuming Fire. When Imagination, Art & Science & all Intel¬ lectual Gifts, all the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, are [despis’d del.] look’d upon as of no use & only Contention remains to Man, then the Last Judgment begins, & its Vision is seen by the [Imaginative Eye del.] of Every one according to the situation he holds.

(Page 68) The Last Judgment is not Fable or Allegory, but Vision.

Fable or Allegory are a totally distinct & inferior kind of Poetry. Vision or Imagination is a Representation of what Eternally Exists, Really & Unchangeably. Fable or Allegory is Form’d by the daughters of Memory. Imagination is sur¬ rounded by the daughters of Inspiration, who in the aggregate are call’d Jerusalem. Fable is allegory, but what Critics call The Fable, is Vision itself. The Hebrew Bible & the Gospel of Jesus are not Allegory, but Eternal Vision or Imagination of All that Exists. Note here that Fable or Allegory is seldom without some Vision. Pilgrim’s Progress is full of it, the Greek Poets the same; but [Fable & Allegory del.] Allegory & Vision [& Visions of Imagination del.] ought to be known as Two Distinct Things, & so call’d for the Sake of Eternal Life.

Plato has made Socrates say that Poets & Prophets do not know or Understand what they write or Utter; this is a most Pernicious Falshood. If they do not, pray is an inferior kind to be call’d Knowing? Plato confutes himself.

(Pages 68-69) The Last Judgment is one of these Stupendous Visions. I have represented it as I saw it; to different People it appears differently as every thing else does; for tho’ on Earth things seem Permanent, they are less permanent than a Shadow, as we all know too well.

The Nature of Visionary Fancy, or Imagination, is very little known, & the Eternal nature & permanence of its ever Existent Images is consider’d as less permanent than the things of Vegetative & Generative Nature; yet the Oak dies as well as the Lettuce, but Its Eternal Image & Individuality never dies, but renews by its seed; just [as del.] so the Imaginative Image returns [according to del.] by the seed of Contemplative Thought; the Writings of the Prophets illustrate these concep¬ tions of the Visionary Fancy by their various sublime & Divine Images as seen in the Worlds of Vision.

(Pages 71-72; The Learned m ... or Heroes; this is an ... & not Spirit¬ ual . . . while the Bible ... of Virtue & Vice ... as they are Ex ... is the Real Di . . . Things. The . . . when they Assert that Jupiter usurped the Throne of his Father, Saturn, & brought on an Iron Age & Begat on Mnemosyne, or Memory, The Great Muses, which are not Inspiration as the Bible is.

Reality was Forgot, & the Vanities of Time & Space only Remember’d & call’d Reality. Such is the Mighty difference between Allegoric Fable & Spiritual Mystery. Let it here be Noted that the Greek Fables originated in Spiritual Mystery & Real Vision, which are lost & clouded in Fable & Allegory, [which del.] while the Hebrew Bible & the Greek Gospel are Genuine, Preserv’d by the Saviour’s Mercy. The Nature of my Work is Visionary or Imaginative; it is an Endeavour to Restore what the Ancients call’d the Golden Age.

(Page 76) No Man of Sense ever supposes that Copying from Nature is the Art of Painting; if Art is no more than this, it is no better than any other Manual Labour; any body may do it & the fool often will do it best as it is a work of no Mind.

(Pages 69-70) This world of Imagination is the world of Eternity; it is the divine bosom into which we shall all go after the death of the Vegetated body. This World of Imagination is Infinite & Eternal, whereas the world of Generation, or Vegetation, is Finite & [for a small moment del.] Temporal. There Exist in that Eternal World the Permanent Realities of Every Thing which we see reflected in this Vegetable Glass of Nature. All Things are comprehended in these Eternal Forms in the divine body of the Saviour, the True Vine of Eternity, The Human Imagination, who appear’d to Me as Coming to Judg¬ ment among his Saints & throwing off the Temporal that the Eternal might be Establish’d; around him were seen the Images of Existences according to [their Aggregate . . . del.] a certain order Suited to my Imaginative Eye [In the follow¬ ing order del.] as follows.

Query, the Above ought to follow the description.

Here follows the description of the Picture: (Page 76) Jesus seated between the Two Pillars, Jachin & Boaz, with the Word divine of Revelation on his knee, & on each side the four & twenty Elders sitting in judgment; the Heavens open¬ ing around him by unfolding the clouds around his throne.

The Old H[eave]n & Ofld] Earth are passing away & the N[ew] H[eaven] & N[ew] Earth descending [as on a Scroll del.]. The Just arise on his right & the wicked on his Left hand. A sea of fire issues from before the throne. Adam & Eve appear first, before the [throne del.] Judgment seat in humilia¬ tion. Abel surrounded by Innocents, & Cain, with the flint in his hand with which he slew his brother, falling with the head downward. From the Cloud on which Eve stands, Satan is seen falling headlong wound round by the tail of the serpent whose bulk, nail’d to the Cross round which he wreathes, is falling into the Abyss. Sin is also represented as a female bound in one of the Serpent’s folds, surrounded by her fiends. Death is Chain’d to the Cross, & Time falls together with death, dragged down by [an Angel del.] a demon crown’d with Laurel; another demon with a Key has the charge of Sin & is dragging her down by the hair; beside them a [scaled del.] figure is seen, scaled with iron scales from head to feet [with del.], precipitat¬ ing himself into the Abyss with the Sword & Balances: he is Og, King of Bashan.

On the Right, Beneath the Cloud on which Abel Kneels, is Abraham with Sarah & Isaac, also Hagar & Ishmael. Abel kneels on a bloody Cloud &c. (to come in here as two leaves forward).

(Page 8o) Abel kneels on a bloody cloud descriptive of those Churches before the flood, that they were fill’d with blood & fire & vapour of smoke; even till Abraham’s time the vapor & heat was not extinguish’d; these States Exist now. Man Passes on, but States remain for Ever; he passes thro’ them like a traveller who may as well suppose that the places he has passed thro’ exist no more, as a Man may suppose that the States he has pass’d thro’ Exist no more. Every thing is Eternal.

(Page 79; In Eternity one Thing never Changes into another Thing.

Each Identity is Eternal: consequently Apuleius’s Golden Ass & Ovid’s Metamorphosis & others of the like kind are Fable; yet they contain Vision in a sublime degree, being derived from real Vision in More ancient Writings. Lot’s Wife being Changed into [a] Pillar of Salt alludes to the Mortal Body being render’d a Permanent Statue, but not Changed or Trans¬ formed into Another Identity while it retains its own Individual¬ ity. A Man can never become Ass nor Horse; some are born with shapes of Men, who may be both, but Eternal Identity is one thing & Corporeal Vegetation is another thing. Changing- Water into Wine by Jesus & into Blood by Moses relates to Vegetable Nature also.

(Pages 76-77; [Beneath] Ishmael is Mahomed, & on the left, beneath the falling figure of Cain, is Moses casting his tables of stone into the deeps. It ought to be understood that the Persons, Moses & Abraham, are not here meant, but the States Signified by those Names, the Individuals being representatives or Visions of those States as they were reveal’d to Mortal Man in the Series of Divine Revelations as they are written in the Bible; these various States I have seen in my Imagination; when distant they appear as One Man, but as you approach they appear Multitudes of Nations. Abraham hovers above his posterity, which appear as Multitudes of Children ascending from the Earth, surrounded by Stars, as it was said: ‘ As the Stars of Heaven for Multitude.’ Jacob & [their del.] his Twelve Sons hover beneath the feet of Abraham & recieve these children from the Earth. I have seen, when at a distance, Multitudes of Men in Harmony appear like a single Infant, sometimes in the Arms of a Female; this represented the Church.

But to proceed with the description of those on the Left hand— beneath the Cloud on which Moses kneels is two figures, a Male & Female, chain’d together by the feet; they represent those who perish’d by the flood; beneath them a multitude of their associates are seen falling headlong; by the side of them is a Mighty fiend with a Book in his hand, which is Shut; he represents the person nam’d in Isaiah, xxii c. & 20 v., Eliakim, the Son of Helkiah: he drags Satan down headlong: he is crown’d with oak [& has deld[ ; by the side of the Scaled figure representing Og, King of Bashan, is a Figure with a Basket, emptying out the varieties of Riches & Worldly Honours: he is Araunah, the Jebusite, master of the threshing floor; above him are two figures, elevated on a Cloud, repre¬ senting the Pharisees who plead their own Righteousness before the throne; they are weighed down by two fiends.

Beneath the Man with the Basket are three fiery fiends with grey beards & scourges of fire: they represent Cruel Laws; they scourge a groupe of figures down into the deeps; beneath them are various figures in attitudes of contention representing various States of Misery, which, alas, every one on Earth is liable to enter into, & against which we should all watch. The Ladies will be pleas’d to see that I have represented the Furies by Three Men & not by three Women. It is not because I think the Ancients wrong, but they will be pleas’d to remember that mine is Vision & not Fable. The Spectator may suppose them Clergymen in the Pulpit, scourging Sin instead of For¬ giving it.

The Earth beneath these falling Groupes of figures is rocky & burning, and seems as if convuls’d by Earthquakes; a Great City on fire is seen in the distance; the armies are fleeing upon the Mountains. On the foreground, hell is opened 6c many figures are descending into it down stone steps & beside a Gate beneath a rock [howling & lamenting del.] where sin & death are to be closed Eternally by that Fiend who carries the key [6c drags del.] in one hand 6c drags them down with the other.

On the rock & above the Gate a fiend with wings urges [them del.] the wicked onwards with fiery darts; he [represents the Assyrian del.] is Hazael, the Syrian, who drives abroad all those who rebell against their Saviour; beneath the steps [is] Babylon, represented by a King crowned, Grasping his Sword & his Sceptre: he is just awaken’d out of his Grave; around him are other Kingdoms arising to Judgment, represented in this Pic¬ ture [as in the Prophets del.] as Single Personages according to the descriptions in the Prophets. The Figure dragging up a Woman by her hair represents the Inquisition, as do those con¬ tending on the sides of the Pit, & in Particular the Man strang¬ ling two women represents a Cruel Church.

(Page j8) Two persons, one in Purple, the other in Scarlet, are descend¬ ing [into Hell del.] down the steps into the Pit; these are Caiaphas & Pilate—Two States where all those reside who Calumniate & Murder under Pretence of Holiness & Justice.

Caiaphas has a Blue Flame like a Miter on his head. Pilate has bloody hands that never can be cleansed; the Females behind them represent the Females belonging to such States, who are under perpetual terrors & vain dreams, plots 6c secret deceit.

Those figures that descend into the Flames before Caiaphas 6c Pilate are Judas & those of his Class. Achitophel is also here with the cord in his hand.

I 2 I (Pages 80-81,) Between the Figures of Adam & Eve appears a fiery Gulph descending from the sea of fire. Before the throne in this Cataract Four Angels descend headlong with four trumpets to awake the dead ; beneath these is the Seat of the Harlot, nam’d Mystery in the Revelations. She is [bound del.] siezed by Two Beings each with three heads; [representing del.] they Repre¬ sent Vegetative Existence; as it is written in Revelations, they strip her naked & burn her with fire; it represents the Eternal Consummation of Vegetable Life & Death with its Lusts. The wreathed Torches in their hands represents Eternal Fire which is the fire of Generation or Vegetation; it is an Eternal Con¬ summation. Those who are blessed with Imaginative Vision see This Eternal Female & tremble at what others fear not, while they despise & laugh at what others fear. Her Kings & Councellors & Warriors descend in Flames, Lamenting & look¬ ing upon her in astonishment & Terror, & Hell is open’d beneath her Seat on the Left hand. Beneath her feet is a flam¬ ing Cavern in which is seen the Great Red Dragon with seven heads & ten Horns [who del.] ; he has Satan’s book of Accusa¬ tions lying on the Rock open before him; he is bound in chains by Two strong demons; they are Gog & Magog, who have been compell’d to subdue their Master (Ezekiel, xxxviii c, 8 v.) with their Hammer & Tongs, about to new-Create the Seven-Headed Kingdoms. The Graves beneath are open’d, & the dead awake & obey the call of the Trumpet; those on the Right hand awake in joy, those on the Left in Horror; beneath the Dragon’s Cavern a Skeleton begins to Animate, starting into life at the Trumpet’s sound, while the Wicked contend with each other on the brink of perdition. On the Right a Youthful couple are awaked by their Children; an Aged patriarch is awaked by his aged wife—He is Albion, our Ancestor, patriarch of the Atlantic Continent, whose History Preceded that of the Hebrews & in whose Sleep, or Chaos, Creation began; [his Emanation or Wife is Jerusalem, who is a spirit of Experience & is the Bride of the .. . del.] ; at their head the Aged Woman is Brittannica, the Wife of Albion: Jerusalem is their daughter. Little Infants creep out of the [ground del.] flowery mould into the Green fields of the blessed who in various joyful companies embrace & ascend to meet Eternity.

The Persons who ascend to Meet the Lord, coming in the Clouds with power & great Glory, are representations of those States described in the Bible under the Names of the Fathers before & after the Flood. Noah is seen in the Midst of these, canopied by a Rainbow, on his right hand Shem & on his Left Japhet; these three Persons represent Poetry, Painting & Music, the three Powers in Man of conversing with Paradise, which the flood did not Sweep away. Above Noah is the Church Universal, represented by a Woman Surrounded by Infants. There is such a State in Eternity: it is composed of the Innocent civilized Heathen & the Uncivilized Savage, who, having not the Law, do by Nature the things contain’d in the Law. This State appears like a Female crown’d with stars, driven into the Wilderness; she has the Moon under her feet.

The Aged Figure with Wings, having a writing tablet & taking account of the numbers who arise, is That Angel of the Divine Presence mention’d in Exodus, xiv c., 19 v. & in other Places; this Angel is frequently call’d by the Name of Jehovah Elohim, The “ I am ” of the Books of Albion.

Around Noah & beneath him are various figures Risen into the Air; among these are Three Females, representing those who are not of the dead but of those found alive at the Last Judgment; they appear to be innocently gay & thoughtless, not being among the condemn’d because ignorant of crime in the midst of a corrupted Age; the Virgin Mary was of this Class. A Mother Meets her numerous Family in the Arms of their Father; these are representations of the Greek Learned & Wise, as also of those of other Nations, such as Egypt & Baby¬ lon, in which were multitudes who shall meet the Lord coming in the Clouds.

The Children of Abraham, or Hebrew Church, are repre¬ sented as a Stream of [Light del.] Figures, in which are seen Stars somewhat like the Milky way; they ascend from the Earth where Figures kneel Embracing above the Graves, & Represent Religion, or Civilized Life such as it is in the Christ¬ ian Church, who are the Offspring of the Hebrew.

(Pages 82-84) Just above the graves & above the spot where the Infants creep out of the Ground stand two, a Man & Woman ; these are the Primitive Christians. The two Figures in purifying flames by the side of the dragon’s cavern represents the Latter state of the Church when on the verge of Perdition, yet protected by a Flaming Sword. Multitudes are seen ascending from the Green fields of the blessed in which a Gothic Church is representative of true Art, Call’d Gothic in All Ages by those who follow’d the Fashion, as that is call’d which is without Shape or Fashion.

On the right hand of Noah a Woman with Children Represents the State Call’d Laban the Syrian ; it is the Remains of Civiliza¬ tion in the State from whence Abraham was taken. Also on the right hand of Noah A Female descends to meet her Lover or Husband, representative of that Love, call’d Friendship, which Looks for no other heaven than their Beloved & in him sees all reflected as in a Glass of Eternal Diamond.

On the right hand of these rise the diffident & Humble, & on their left a solitary Woman with her infant: these are caught up by three aged Men who appear as suddenly emerging from the blue sky for their help. These three Aged Men represent divine Providence as oppos’d to, & distinct from, divine ven¬ geance, represented by three Aged men on the side of the Picture among the Wicked, with scourges of fire.

If the Spectator could Enter into these Images in his Imagina¬ tions, approaching them on the Fiery Chariot of his Contem¬ plative Thought, if he could Enter into Noah’s Rainbow or into his bosom, or could make a Friend & Companion of one of these Images of wonder, which always intreats him to leave mortal things (as he must know), then would he arise from his Grave, then would he meet the Lord in the Air & then he would be happy. General Knowledge is Remote Knowledge; it is in Particulars that Wisdom consists & Happiness too.

Both in Art & in Life, General Masses are as Much Art as a Pasteboard Man is Human. Every Man has Eyes, Nose & Mouth; this Every Idiot knows, but he who enters into & dis¬ criminates most minutely the Manners & Intentions, the [Expression del.\ Characters in all their branches, is the alone Wise or Sensible Man, & on this discrimination All Art is founded. I intreat, then, that the Spectator will attend to the Hands & Feet, to the Lineaments of the Countenances; they are all descriptive of Character, & not a line is drawn without intention, & that most discriminate & particular. As Poetry admits not a Letter that is Insignificant, so Painting admits not a Grain of Sand or a Blade of Grass Insignificant—much less an Insignificant Blur or Mark.

Above the Head of Noah is Seth; this State call’d Seth is Male & Female in a higher state of Happiness & wisdom than Noah, being nearer the State of Innocence; beneath the feet of Seth two figures represent the two Seasons of Spring & Autumn, while beneath the feet of Noah four Seasons represent [our present changes of Extremes del.] the Changed State made by the flood.

By the side of Seth is Elijah; he comprehends all the Prophetic Characters; he is seen on his fiery Chariot, bowing before the throne of the Saviour; in like manner The figures of Seth & his wife comprehends the Fathers before the flood & their Generations; when seen remote they appear as One Man; a little below Seth on his right are Two Figures, a Male & Female, with numerous Children; these represent those who were not in the Line of the Church & yet were Saved from among the Antediluvians who Perished; between Seth & these a female figure [with the back turn’d del.] represents the Solitary State of those who, previous to the Flood, walked with God.

All these arise toward the opening Cloud before the Throne, led onward by triumphant Groupes of Infants, & the Morning Stars sing together. Between Seth & Elijah three Female Figures crown’d with Garlands Represent Learning & Science, which accompanied Adam out of Eden.

The Cloud that opens, rolling apart before the throne & before the New Heaven & the New Earth, is Composed of Various Groupes of Figures, particularly the Four Living Creatures mention’d in Revelations as Surrounding the Throne; these I suppose to have the chief agency in removing the [fools del.] old heavens & the old Earth to make way for the New Heaven & the New Earth, to descend from the throne of God & of the Lamb; that Living Creature on the Left of the Throne Gives to the Seven Angels the Seven Vials of the wrath of God, with which they, hovering over the deeps beneath, pour out upon the wicked their Plagues; the Other Living Creatures are descending with a Shout & with the Sound of the Trumpet & with directing the Combats in the upper Elements ; in the two Corners of the Picture [where . . . Apollyon del.], on the Left hand Apollyon is foiled before the Sword of Michael, & on the Right the Two Witnesses are subduing their Enemies.

[Around the Throne Heaven is Opened del.] On the Cloud are open’d the Books of Remembrance of Life & of Death: before that of Life, on the Right, some figures bow in humilia¬ tion ; before that of Death, on the Left, the Pharisees are plead¬ ing their own Righteousness; the one shines with beams of Light, the other utters Lightnings & tempests.

A Last Judgment is Necessary because Fools flourish. Nations Flourish under Wise Rulers & are depress’d under foolish Rulers; it is the same with Individuals as Nations; works of Art can only be produc’d in Perfection where the Man is either in Affluence or it Above the Care of it. Poverty is the Fool’s Rod, which at last is turn’d on his own back; this is A Last Judgment—when Men of Real Art Govern & Pretenders Fall.

Some People & not a few Artists have asserted that the Painter of this Picture would not have done so well if he had been properly Encourag’d. Let those who think so, reflect on the State of Nations under Poverty & their incapability of Art; tho’ Art is Above Either, the Argument is better for Affluence than Poverty; & tho’ he would not have been a greater Artist, yet he would have produc’d Greater works of Art in proportion to his means. A Last Judgment is not for the purpose of making Bad Men better, but for the Purpose of hindering them from opressing the Good with Poverty & Pain by means of Such Vile Arguments & Insinuations.

Around the Throne Heaven is open’d & the Nature of Eter¬ nal Things Display’d, All Springing from the Divine Huma¬ nity. All beams from him [& (Because del.) as he himself has said. All dwells in him del.]. He is the Bread & the Wine ; he is the Water of Life; accordingly on Each Side of the opening Heaven appears an Apostle; [one del.] that on the Right Represents Baptism, [& the Other del.] that on the Left Represents the Lord’s Supper. All Life consists of these Two, Throwing ofh Error & Knaves from our company continually & Recieving Truth or Wise Men into our Company conti¬ nually. He who is out of the Church & opposes it is no less an Agent of Religion than he who is in it; to be an Error & to be Cast out is a part of God’s design. No man can Embrace True Art till he has Explor’d & cast out False Art (such is the Na¬ ture of Mortal Things), or he will be himself Cast out by those who have Already Embraced True Art. Thus My Picture is a History of Art & Science, the Foundation of Society, [all del.] Which is Humanity itself. What are all the Gifts of the Spirit but Mental Gifts? Whenever any Individual Rejects Error & Embraces Truth, a Last Judgment passes upon that Individual.

(Page 85; Over the Head of the Saviour & Redeemer The Holy Spirit, like a Dove, is surrounded by a blue Heaven in which are the two Cherubim that bow’d over the Ark, for here the temple is open’d in Heaven & the Ark of the Covenant is as a Dove of Peace. The Curtains are drawn apart, Christ having rent the Veil. The Candlestick & the Table of Shew-bread appear on Each side; a Glorification of Angels with Harps surround the Dove.

The Temple stands on the Mount of God; from it flows on each side the River of Life, on whose banks Grows the tree of Life, among whose branches temples & Pinnacles, tents & pavilions, Gardens & Groves, display Paradise with its Inhabi- tants walking up & down in Conversations concerning Mental Delights. Here they are &c. (as three leaves on).

(Pages 90-91; Here they are no longer talking of what is Good & Evil, or of what is Right or Wrong, & puzzling themselves in Satan’s [Maze del.] Labyrinth, But are Conversing with Eternal Real¬ ities as they Exist in the Human Imagination. We are in a World of Generation & death, & this world we must cast off if we would be Painters such as Rafael, Mich. Angelo & the Ancient Sculptors; if we do not cast off this world we shall be only Venetian Painters, who will be cast off & Lost from Art.

(Page 85; Jesus is surrounded by Beams of Glory in which are seen all around him Infants emanating from him; these represent the Eternal Births of Intellect from the divine Humanity. A Rain¬ bow surrounds the throne & the Glory, in which youthful Nuptials recieve the infants in their hands. In Eternity Woman is the Emanation of Man ; she has No Will of her own.

There is no such thing in Eternity as a Female Will, & Queens [of England del.].

On the Side next Baptism are seen those call’d in the Bible Nursing Fathers & Nursing Mothers; [they have Crowns; the Spectator may suppose them to be the Good . . . del.] they represent Education. On the Side next the Lord’s Supper The Holy Family, consisting of Mary, Joseph, John the Baptist, Zacharias & Elizabeth, recieving the Bread & Wine, among other Spirits of the Just made perfect. [Just del.] beneath these a Cloud of Women & Children are taken up, fleeing from the rolling Cloud which separates the Wicked from the Seats of Bliss. These represent those who, tho’ willing, were too weak to Reject Error without the Assistance & Countenance of those Already in the Truth ; for a Man Can only Reject Error by the Advice of a Friend or by the Immediate Inspiration of God ; it is for this Reason among many others that I have put the Lord’s Supper on the Left hand of the [Picture dell] Throne, for it appears so at the Last Judgment, for a Protection.

(Page 86j The Painter hopes that his Friends Anytus, [& del.] Melitus & Lycon will percieve that they are not now in Ancient Greece, & tho’ they can use the Poison of Calumny, the English Public will be convinc’d that such a Picture as this Could never be Painted by a Madman or by one in a State of Outrageous manners, as these [Villains del.] Bad Men both Print & Publish by all the means in their Power; the Painter begs Public Protection & all will be well.

(Pages 91-92) Many suppose that before [word del.] the Creation All was Solitude & Chaos. This is the most pernicious Idea that can enter the Mind, as it takes away all sublimity from the Bible & Limits All Existence to Creation & to Chaos, To the Time & Space fixed by the Corporeal Vegetative Eye, & leaves the Man who entertains such an Idea the habitation of Unbeliev¬ ing demons. Eternity Exists, and All things in Eternity, Inde¬ pendent of Creation which was an act of Mercy. I have repre¬ sented those who are in Eternity by some in a Cloud within the Rainbow that Surrounds the Throne ; they merely appear as in a Cloud when any thing of Creation, Redemption or Judgment are the Subjects of Contemplation, tho’ their Whole Contem- plation is concerning these things; the Reason they so appear is The Humiliation of the Reason & doubting Self-hood, & the Giving all up to Inspiration. By this it will be seen that I do not consider either the Just or the Wicked to be in a Supreme State, but to be every one of them States of the Sleep [of del.\ which the Soul may fall into in its deadly dreams of Good & Evil when it leaves Paradise [with del.] following the Serpent.

(Page 91 sideways) The Greeks represent Chronos or Time as a very Aged Man ; this is Fable, but the Real Vision of Time is in Eternal Youth.

I have, however, somewhat accomodated my Figure of Time to the common opinion, as I myself am also infected with it & my Visions also infected, & I see Time Aged, alas, too much so.

Allegories are things that Relate to Moral Virtues. Moral Virtues do not Exist; they are Allegories & dissimulations. But Time & Space are Real Beings, a Male & a Female. Time is a Man, Space is a Woman, & her Masculine Portion is Death.

(Pages 86, 90J The Combats of Good & Evil [& of Truth & Error which are the same thing del.] is Eating of the Tree of Knowledge. The Combats of Truth & Error is Eating of the Tree of Life; these are not only Universal, but Particular. Each are Personified.

There is not an Error, but it has a Man for its [Actor del.] Agent, that is, it is a Man. There is not a Truth but it has also a Man. Good & Evil are Qualities in Every Man, whether a Good or Evil Man. These are Enemies & destroy one another by every Means in their power, both of deceit & of open Violence. The deist & the Christian are but the Results of these Opposing Natures. Many are deists who would in certain Circumstances have been Christians in outward appearance.

Voltaire was one of this number; he was as intolerant as an Inqui¬ sitor. Manners make the Man, not Habits. It is the same in Art: by their Works ye shall know them; the Knave who is Convert¬ ed to [Christianity del.] Deism & the Knave who is Converted to Christianity is still a Knave, but he himself will not know it, tho’ Every body else does. Christ comes, as he came at first, to deliver those who were bound under the Knave, not to de¬ liver the Knave. He Comes to deliver Man, the Accused, & not Satan, the Accuser. We do not find any where that Satan is Accused of Sin ; he is only accused of Unbelief & thereby draw¬ ing Man into Sin that he may accuse him. Such is the Last Judg¬ ment— a deliverance from Satan’s Accusation. Satan thinks that Sin is displeasing to God; he ought to know that Nothing is displeasing to God but Unbelief & Eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good & Evil.

(Page 87; Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed & govern’d their Passions or have No Passions, but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion, but Realities of Intellect, from which all the Passions Emanate Uncurbed in their Eter¬ nal Glory. The Fool shall not enter into Heaven let him be ever so Holy. Holiness is not The Price of Enterance into Heaven.

Those who are cast out are All Those who, having no Passions of their own because No Intellect, Have spent their lives in Curbing & Governing other People’s by the Various arts of Poverty & Cruelty of all kinds. The Modern Church Crucifies Christ with the Head Downwards. Wo, Wo, Wo to you Hypo¬ crites. Even Murder, the Courts of Justice, more merciful than
